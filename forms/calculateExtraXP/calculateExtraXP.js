/*Code from the calculate form has been copied and pasted into a new form named calculateExtraXP.
Removed all the 'let' commands from the copy (so you aren't re-creating the variables).
Asks the user if they want to do an average calculation or a random multiplication.
Gets a number from the user.
Uses a newly created function named randomMultiply that takes 1 parameter and multiplies a random number between 1 and 10 with the parameter number. Then returns the answer. 
Calls the appropriate function from the main program. 
Outputs the answer in an alert window with a template literal using this format: 

The result of multiplying the random number 9 with 100 is 900.

All user input and output is in main program, not in the function.
Code is all commented out. 
Program runs without error */
