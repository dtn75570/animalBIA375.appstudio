/*Created a new form named animals.
    Created an array named myAnimals with these animals in it:
       dog, cat, horse, meerkat
    Got the name of an animal from the user and adds it to the end of the array using an array method. 
    Included code so the user can use any mix of case to enter the animal name. 
    eg. the user could enter:
            eagle
            Eagle
            EAGLE
            EaglE
                etc.
    Output the last animal in the array using an array method to an alert using a template literal to the console with the format below. Used the myAnimals array in the template literal to show the last animal added: 
    eg. Say the last animal in the array is 'eagle'. Then the output would be: 
           "The last animal is a/an eagle."
    Code is all commented out. 
    Program runs without error.
